  "abstract": "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models Peters et al. (2018a); Radford et al. (2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

        "Language model pre-training has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks Dai and Le (2015); Peters et al. (2018a); Radford et al. (2018); Howard and Ruder (2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference Bowman et al. (2015); Williams et al. (2018) and paraphrasing Dolan and Brockett (2005), which aim to predict the relationships between sentences by analyzing them holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as named entity recognition and question answering, where models are required to produce fine-grained output at the token level Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder (2003); Rajpurkar et al. (2016).",
        "There are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo Peters et al. (2018a), uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) Radford et al. (2018), introduces minimal task-specific parameters, and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pre-trained parameters. The two approaches share the same objective function during pre-training, where they use unidirectional language models to learn general language representations.",
        "We argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, especially for the fine-tuning approaches. The major limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training. For example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-right architecture, where every token can only attend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers of the Transformer Vaswani et al. (2017). Such restrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks, and could be very harmful when applying fine-tuning based approaches to token-level tasks such as question answering, where it is crucial to incorporate context from both directions.",
        "In this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a “masked language model” (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task Taylor (1953). The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike left-to-right language model pre-training, the MLM objective enables the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pre-train a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addition to the masked language model, we also use a “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-trains text-pair representations. The contributions of our paper are as follows:",
        "We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations. Unlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirectional language models for pre-training, BERT uses masked language models to enable pre-trained deep bidirectional representations. This is also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which uses a shallow concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.",
        "We show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered task-specific architectures. BERT is the first fine-tuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specific architectures.",

(2006) and neural Mikolov et al. (2013); Pennington et al. (2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings are an integral part of modern NLP systems, offering significant improvements over embeddings learned from scratch Turian et al. (2010). To pre-train word embedding vectors, left-to-right language modeling objectives have been used Mnih and Hinton (2009), as well as objectives to discriminate correct from incorrect words in left and right context Mikolov et al. (2013).",
            "These approaches have been generalized to coarser granularities, such as sentence embeddings Kiros et al. (2015); Logeswaran and Lee (2018) or paragraph embeddings Le and Mikolov (2014). To train sentence representations, prior work has used objectives to rank candidate next sentences Jernite et al. (2017); Logeswaran and Lee (2018), left-to-right generation of next sentence words given a representation of the previous sentence Kiros et al. (2015), or denoising auto-encoder derived objectives Hill et al. (2016).",

They extract context-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a right-to-left language model. The contextual representation of each token is the concatenation of the left-to-right and right-to-left representations. When integrating contextual word embeddings with existing task-specific architectures, ELMo advances the state of the art for several major NLP benchmarks Peters et al. (2018a) including question answering Rajpurkar et al. (2016), sentiment analysis Socher et al. (2013), and named entity recognition Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder (2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning contextual representations through a task to predict a single word from both left and right context using LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is feature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus et al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used to improve the robustness of text generation models."

            "Fine-tuning is straightforward since the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer allows BERT to model many downstream tasks—whether they involve single text or text pairs—by swapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs. For applications involving text pairs, a common pattern is to independently encode text pairs before applying bidirectional cross attention, such as Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT instead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify these two stages, as encoding a concatenated text pair with self-attention effectively includes bidirectional cross attention between two sentences.",

At the input, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training are analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphrasing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3) question-passage pairs in question answering, and (4) a degenerate text-∅\\varnothing pair in text classification or sequence tagging. At the output, the token representations are fed into an output layer for token-level tasks, such as sequence tagging or question answering, and the [CLS] representation is fed into an output layer for classification, such as entailment or sentiment analysis.",

All of the results in the paper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a single Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting from the exact same pre-trained model.777For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in around 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev F1 score of 91.0%.

LTR & No NSP: A left-context-only model which is trained using a standard Left-to-Right (LTR) LM, rather than an MLM. The left-only constraint was also applied at fine-tuning, because removing it introduced a pre-train/fine-tune mismatch that degraded downstream performance. Additionally, this model was pre-trained without the NSP task. This is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but using our larger training dataset, our input representation, and our fine-tuning scheme.",

The LTR model performs worse than the MLM model on all tasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.",

It is also perhaps surprising that we are able to achieve such significant improvements on top of models which are already quite large relative to the existing literature. For example, the largest Transformer explored in Vaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16) with 100M parameters for the encoder, and the largest Transformer we have found in the literature is (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters Al-Rfou et al. (2018).

However, we believe that this is the first work to demonstrate convincingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also leads to large improvements on very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been sufficiently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented mixed results on the downstream task impact of increasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two to four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) mentioned in passing that increasing hidden dimension size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing further to 1,000 did not bring further improvements. Both of these prior works used a feature-based approach — we hypothesize that when the model is fine-tuned directly on the downstream tasks and uses only a very small number of randomly initialized additional parameters, the task-specific models can benefit from the larger, more expressive pre-trained representations even when downstream task data is very small."

First, not all tasks can be easily represented by a Transformer encoder architecture, and therefore require a task-specific model architecture to be added. Second, there are major computational benefits to pre-compute an expensive representation of the training data once and then run many experiments with cheaper models on top of this representation.",
            "In this section, we compare the two approaches by applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition (NER) task Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder (2003). In the input to BERT, we use a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we include the maximal document context provided by the data. Following standard practice, we formulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF layer in the output. We use the representation of the first sub-token as the input to the token-level classifier over the NER label set.",
            "To ablate the fine-tuning approach, we apply the feature-based approach by extracting the activations from one or more layers without fine-tuning any parameters of BERT. These contextual embeddings are used as input to a randomly initialized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before the classification layer.",
            "Results are presented in Table 7. BERTLARGELARGE{}_{\\textsc{LARGE}} performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods. The best performing method concatenates the token representations from the top four hidden layers of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only 0.3 F1 behind fine-tuning the entire model. This demonstrates that BERT is effective for both fine-tuning and feature-based approaches."

        "Recent empirical improvements due to transfer learning with language models have demonstrated that rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral part of many language understanding systems. In particular, these results enable even low-resource tasks to benefit from deep unidirectional architectures. Our major contribution is further generalizing these findings to deep bidirectional architectures, allowing the same pre-trained model to successfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks."

  "full_text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks Dai and Le (2015); Peters et al. (2018a); Radford et al. (2018); Howard and Ruder (2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference Bowman et al. (2015); Williams et al. (2018) and paraphrasing Dolan and Brockett (2005), which aim to predict the relationships between sentences by analyzing them holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as named entity recognition and question answering, where models are required to produce fine-grained output at the token level Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder (2003); Rajpurkar et al. (2016).\n\nThere are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo Peters et al. (2018a), uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) Radford et al. (2018), introduces minimal task-specific parameters, and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pre-trained parameters. The two approaches share the same objective function during pre-training, where they use unidirectional language models to learn general language representations.\n\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, especially for the fine-tuning approaches. The major limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training. For example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-right architecture, where every token can only attend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers of the Transformer Vaswani et al. (2017). Such restrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks, and could be very harmful when applying fine-tuning based approaches to token-level tasks such as question answering, where it is crucial to incorporate context from both directions.\n\nIn this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a “masked language model” (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task Taylor (1953). The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike left-to-right language model pre-training, the MLM objective enables the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pre-train a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addition to the masked language model, we also use a “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-trains text-pair representations. The contributions of our paper are as follows:\n\nWe demonstrate the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations. Unlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirectional language models for pre-training, BERT uses masked language models to enable pre-trained deep bidirectional representations. This is also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which uses a shallow concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\n\nWe show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered task-specific architectures. BERT is the first fine-tuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specific architectures.\n\nBERT advances the state of the art for eleven NLP tasks. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/google-research/bert.\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nThere is a long history of pre-training general language representations, and we briefly review the most widely-used approaches in this section.\n\n### 2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\n\nLearning widely applicable representations of words has been an active area of research for decades, including non-neural Brown et al. (1992); Ando and Zhang (2005); Blitzer et al. (2006) and neural Mikolov et al. (2013); Pennington et al. (2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings are an integral part of modern NLP systems, offering significant improvements over embeddings learned from scratch Turian et al. (2010). To pre-train word embedding vectors, left-to-right language modeling objectives have been used Mnih and Hinton (2009), as well as objectives to discriminate correct from incorrect words in left and right context Mikolov et al. (2013).\n\nThese approaches have been generalized to coarser granularities, such as sentence embeddings Kiros et al. (2015); Logeswaran and Lee (2018) or paragraph embeddings Le and Mikolov (2014). To train sentence representations, prior work has used objectives to rank candidate next sentences Jernite et al. (2017); Logeswaran and Lee (2018), left-to-right generation of next sentence words given a representation of the previous sentence Kiros et al. (2015), or denoising auto-encoder derived objectives Hill et al. (2016).\n\nELMo and its predecessor Peters et al. (2017, 2018a) generalize traditional word embedding research along a different dimension. They extract context-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a right-to-left language model. The contextual representation of each token is the concatenation of the left-to-right and right-to-left representations. When integrating contextual word embeddings with existing task-specific architectures, ELMo advances the state of the art for several major NLP benchmarks Peters et al. (2018a) including question answering Rajpurkar et al. (2016), sentiment analysis Socher et al. (2013), and named entity recognition Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder (2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning contextual representations through a task to predict a single word from both left and right context using LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is feature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus et al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used to improve the robustness of text generation models.\n\n### 2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\n\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the first works in this direction only pre-trained word embedding parameters from unlabeled text Collobert and Weston (2008).\n\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders which produce contextual token representations have been pre-trained from unlabeled text and fine-tuned for a supervised downstream task Dai and Le (2015); Howard and Ruder (2018); Radford et al. (2018). The advantage of these approaches is that few parameters need to be learned from scratch. At least partly due to this advantage, OpenAI GPT Radford et al. (2018) achieved previously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-level tasks from the GLUE benchmark Wang et al. (2018a). Left-to-right language modeling and auto-encoder objectives have been used for pre-training such models Howard and Ruder (2018); Radford et al. (2018); Dai and Le (2015).\n\n### 2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\n\nThere has also been work showing effective transfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such as natural language inference Conneau et al. (2017) and machine translation McCann et al. (2017). Computer vision research has also demonstrated the importance of transfer learning from large pre-trained models, where an effective recipe is to fine-tune models pre-trained with ImageNet Deng et al. (2009); Yosinski et al. (2014).\n\n## 3 BERT\n\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementation in this section. There are two steps in our framework: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled data over different pre-training tasks. For fine-tuning, the BERT model is first initialized with the pre-trained parameters, and all of the parameters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the downstream tasks. Each downstream task has separate fine-tuned models, even though they are initialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The question-answering example in Figure 1 will serve as a running example for this section.\n\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its unified architecture across different tasks. There is minimal difference between the pre-trained architecture and the final downstream architecture.\n\n### 3.1 Pre-training BERT\n\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al. (2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or right-to-left language models to pre-train BERT. Instead, we pre-train BERT using two unsupervised tasks, described in this section. This step is presented in the left part of Figure 1.\n\n### 3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\n\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer allows BERT to model many downstream tasks—whether they involve single text or text pairs—by swapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs. For applications involving text pairs, a common pattern is to independently encode text pairs before applying bidirectional cross attention, such as Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT instead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify these two stages, as encoding a concatenated text pair with self-attention effectively includes bidirectional cross attention between two sentences.\n\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-specific inputs and outputs into BERT and fine-tune all the parameters end-to-end. At the input, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training are analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphrasing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3) question-passage pairs in question answering, and (4) a degenerate text-∅\\varnothing pair in text classification or sequence tagging. At the output, the token representations are fed into an output layer for token-level tasks, such as sequence tagging or question answering, and the [CLS] representation is fed into an output layer for classification, such as entailment or sentiment analysis.\n\nCompared to pre-training, fine-tuning is relatively inexpensive. All of the results in the paper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a single Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting from the exact same pre-trained model.777For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in around 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev F1 score of 91.0%. We describe the task-specific details in the corresponding subsections of Section 4. More details can be found in Appendix A.5.\n\n## 4 Experiments\n\nIn this section, we present BERT fine-tuning results on 11 NLP tasks.\n\n### 4.1 GLUE\n\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark Wang et al. (2018a) is a collection of diverse natural language understanding tasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are included in Appendix B.1.\n\nTo fine-tune on GLUE, we represent the input sequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs) as described in Section 3, and use the final hidden vector C∈ℝH𝐶superscriptℝ𝐻C\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H} corresponding to the first input token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representation. The only new parameters introduced during fine-tuning are classification layer weights W∈ℝK×H𝑊superscriptℝ𝐾𝐻W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times H}, where K𝐾K is the number of labels. We compute a standard classification loss with C𝐶C and W𝑊W, i.e., log⁡(softmax​(C​WT))softmax𝐶superscript𝑊𝑇\\log({\\rm softmax}(CW^{T})).\n\nWe use a batch size of 32 and fine-tune for 3 epochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each task, we selected the best fine-tuning learning rate (among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set. Additionally, for BERTLARGELARGE{}_{\\textsc{LARGE}} we found that fine-tuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets, so we ran several random restarts and selected the best model on the Dev set. With random restarts, we use the same pre-trained checkpoint but perform different fine-tuning data shuffling and classifier layer initialization.101010The GLUE data set distribution does not include the Test labels, and we only made a single GLUE evaluation server submission for each of BERTBASEBASE{}_{\\textsc{BASE}} and BERTLARGELARGE{}_{\\textsc{LARGE}}.\n\nResults are presented in Table 9. Both BERTBASEBASE{}_{\\textsc{BASE}} and BERTLARGELARGE{}_{\\textsc{LARGE}} outperform all systems on all tasks by a substantial margin, obtaining 4.5% and 7.0% respective average accuracy improvement over the prior state of the art. Note that BERTBASEBASE{}_{\\textsc{BASE}} and OpenAI GPT are nearly identical in terms of model architecture apart from the attention masking. For the largest and most widely reported GLUE task, MNLI, BERT obtains a 4.6% absolute accuracy improvement. On the official GLUE leaderboard111111https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard, BERTLARGELARGE{}_{\\textsc{LARGE}} obtains a score of 80.5, compared to OpenAI GPT, which obtains 72.8 as of the date of writing.\n\nWe find that BERTLARGELARGE{}_{\\textsc{LARGE}} significantly outperforms BERTBASEBASE{}_{\\textsc{BASE}} across all tasks, especially those with very little training data. The effect of model size is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2.\n\n### 4.2 SQuAD v1.1\n\nThe Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD v1.1) is a collection of 100k crowdsourced question/answer pairs Rajpurkar et al. (2016). Given a question and a passage from Wikipedia containing the answer, the task is to predict the answer text span in the passage.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, in the question answering task, we represent the input question and passage as a single packed sequence, with the question using the A embedding and the passage using the B embedding. We only introduce a start vector S∈ℝH𝑆superscriptℝ𝐻S\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H} and an end vector E∈ℝH𝐸superscriptℝ𝐻E\\in\\mathbb{R}^{H} during fine-tuning. The probability of word i𝑖i being the start of the answer span is computed as a dot product between Tisubscript𝑇𝑖T_{i} and S𝑆S followed by a softmax over all of the words in the paragraph: Pi=eS⋅Ti∑jeS⋅Tjsubscript𝑃𝑖superscript𝑒⋅𝑆subscript𝑇𝑖subscript𝑗superscript𝑒⋅𝑆subscript𝑇𝑗P_{i}=\\frac{e^{S{\\cdot}T_{i}}}{\\sum_{j}e^{S{\\cdot}T_{j}}}. The analogous formula is used for the end of the answer span. The score of a candidate span from position i𝑖i to position j𝑗j is defined as S⋅Ti+E⋅Tj⋅𝑆subscript𝑇𝑖⋅𝐸subscript𝑇𝑗S{\\cdot}T_{i}+E{\\cdot}T_{j}, and the maximum scoring span where j≥i𝑗𝑖j\\geq i is used as a prediction. The training objective is the sum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and end positions. We fine-tune for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\n\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well as results from top published systems Seo et al. (2017); Clark and Gardner (2018); Peters et al. (2018a); Hu et al. (2018). The top results from the SQuAD leaderboard do not have up-to-date public system descriptions available,121212QANet is described in Yu et al. (2018), but the system has improved substantially after publication. and are allowed to use any public data when training their systems. We therefore use modest data augmentation in our system by first fine-tuning on TriviaQA Joshi et al. (2017) befor fine-tuning on SQuAD.\n\nOur best performing system outperforms the top leaderboard system by +1.5 F1 in ensembling and +1.3 F1 as a single system. In fact, our single BERT model outperforms the top ensemble system in terms of F1 score. Without TriviaQA fine-tuning data, we only lose 0.1-0.4 F1, still outperforming all existing systems by a wide margin.131313The TriviaQA data we used consists of paragraphs from TriviaQA-Wiki formed of the first 400 tokens in documents, that contain at least one of the provided possible answers.\n\n### 4.3 SQuAD v2.0\n\nThe SQuAD 2.0 task extends the SQuAD 1.1 problem definition by allowing for the possibility that no short answer exists in the provided paragraph, making the problem more realistic.\n\nWe use a simple approach to extend the SQuAD v1.1 BERT model for this task. We treat questions that do not have an answer as having an answer span with start and end at the [CLS] token. The probability space for the start and end answer span positions is extended to include the position of the [CLS] token. For prediction, we compare the score of the no-answer span: s𝚗𝚞𝚕𝚕=S⋅C+E⋅Csubscript𝑠𝚗𝚞𝚕𝚕⋅𝑆𝐶⋅𝐸𝐶s_{\\tt null}=S{\\cdot}C+E{\\cdot}C to the score of the best non-null span si,j^^subscript𝑠𝑖𝑗\\hat{s_{i,j}} = 𝚖𝚊𝚡j≥i​S⋅Ti+E⋅Tj⋅subscript𝚖𝚊𝚡𝑗𝑖𝑆subscript𝑇𝑖⋅𝐸subscript𝑇𝑗{\\tt max}_{j\\geq i}S{\\cdot}T_{i}+E{\\cdot}T_{j}. We predict a non-null answer when si,j^>s𝚗𝚞𝚕𝚕+τ^subscript𝑠𝑖𝑗subscript𝑠𝚗𝚞𝚕𝚕𝜏\\hat{s_{i,j}}>s_{\\tt null}+\\tau, where the threshold τ𝜏\\tau is selected on the dev set to maximize F1. We did not use TriviaQA data for this model. We fine-tuned for 2 epochs with a learning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 48.\n\nThe results compared to prior leaderboard entries and top published work Sun et al. (2018); Wang et al. (2018b) are shown in Table 3, excluding systems that use BERT as one of their components. We observe a +5.1 F1 improvement over the previous best system.\n\n### 4.4 SWAG\n\nThe Situations With Adversarial Generations (SWAG) dataset contains 113k sentence-pair completion examples that evaluate grounded commonsense inference Zellers et al. (2018). Given a sentence, the task is to choose the most plausible continuation among four choices.\n\nWhen fine-tuning on the SWAG dataset, we construct four input sequences, each containing the concatenation of the given sentence (sentence A) and a possible continuation (sentence B). The only task-specific parameters introduced is a vector whose dot product with the [CLS] token representation C𝐶C denotes a score for each choice which is normalized with a softmax layer.\n\nWe fine-tune the model for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 16. Results are presented in Table 4. BERTLARGELARGE{}_{\\textsc{LARGE}} outperforms the authors’ baseline ESIM+ELMo system by +27.1% and OpenAI GPT by 8.3%.\n\n## 5 Ablation Studies\n\nIn this section, we perform ablation experiments over a number of facets of BERT in order to better understand their relative importance. Additional ablation studies can be found in Appendix C.\n\n### 5.1 Effect of Pre-training Tasks\n\nWe demonstrate the importance of the deep bidirectionality of BERT by evaluating two pre-training objectives using exactly the same pre-training data, fine-tuning scheme, and hyperparameters as BERTBASEBASE{}_{\\textsc{BASE}}: No NSP: A bidirectional model which is trained using the “masked LM” (MLM) but without the “next sentence prediction” (NSP) task. LTR & No NSP: A left-context-only model which is trained using a standard Left-to-Right (LTR) LM, rather than an MLM. The left-only constraint was also applied at fine-tuning, because removing it introduced a pre-train/fine-tune mismatch that degraded downstream performance. Additionally, this model was pre-trained without the NSP task. This is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but using our larger training dataset, our input representation, and our fine-tuning scheme.\n\nWe first examine the impact brought by the NSP task. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP hurts performance significantly on QNLI, MNLI, and SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact of training bidirectional representations by comparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR model performs worse than the MLM model on all tasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\n\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR model will perform poorly at token predictions, since the token-level hidden states have no right-side context. In order to make a good faith attempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added a randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does significantly improve results on SQuAD, but the results are still far worse than those of the pre-trained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts performance on the GLUE tasks.\n\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to train separate LTR and RTL models and represent each token as the concatenation of the two models, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as expensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this is non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL model would not be able to condition the answer on the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful than a deep bidirectional model, since it can use both left and right context at every layer.\n\n### 5.2 Effect of Model Size\n\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size on fine-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number of BERT models with a differing number of layers, hidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise using the same hyperparameters and training procedure as described previously.\n\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in Table 6. In this table, we report the average Dev Set accuracy from 5 random restarts of fine-tuning. We can see that larger models lead to a strict accuracy improvement across all four datasets, even for MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled training examples, and is substantially different from the pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surprising that we are able to achieve such significant improvements on top of models which are already quite large relative to the existing literature. For example, the largest Transformer explored in Vaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16) with 100M parameters for the encoder, and the largest Transformer we have found in the literature is (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters Al-Rfou et al. (2018). By contrast, BERTBASEBASE{}_{\\textsc{BASE}} contains 110M parameters and BERTLARGELARGE{}_{\\textsc{LARGE}} contains 340M parameters.\n\nIt has long been known that increasing the model size will lead to continual improvements on large-scale tasks such as machine translation and language modeling, which is demonstrated by the LM perplexity of held-out training data shown in Table 6. However, we believe that this is the first work to demonstrate convincingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also leads to large improvements on very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been sufficiently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented mixed results on the downstream task impact of increasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two to four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) mentioned in passing that increasing hidden dimension size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing further to 1,000 did not bring further improvements. Both of these prior works used a feature-based approach — we hypothesize that when the model is fine-tuned directly on the downstream tasks and uses only a very small number of randomly initialized additional parameters, the task-specific models can benefit from the larger, more expressive pre-trained representations even when downstream task data is very small.\n\n### 5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\n\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used the fine-tuning approach, where a simple classification layer is added to the pre-trained model, and all parameters are jointly fine-tuned on a downstream task. However, the feature-based approach, where fixed features are extracted from the pre-trained model, has certain advantages. First, not all tasks can be easily represented by a Transformer encoder architecture, and therefore require a task-specific model architecture to be added. Second, there are major computational benefits to pre-compute an expensive representation of the training data once and then run many experiments with cheaper models on top of this representation.\n\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches by applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition (NER) task Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder (2003). In the input to BERT, we use a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we include the maximal document context provided by the data. Following standard practice, we formulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF layer in the output. We use the representation of the first sub-token as the input to the token-level classifier over the NER label set.\n\nTo ablate the fine-tuning approach, we apply the feature-based approach by extracting the activations from one or more layers without fine-tuning any parameters of BERT. These contextual embeddings are used as input to a randomly initialized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before the classification layer.\n\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERTLARGELARGE{}_{\\textsc{LARGE}} performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods. The best performing method concatenates the token representations from the top four hidden layers of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only 0.3 F1 behind fine-tuning the entire model. This demonstrates that BERT is effective for both fine-tuning and feature-based approaches.\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer learning with language models have demonstrated that rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral part of many language understanding systems. In particular, these results enable even low-resource tasks to benefit from deep unidirectional architectures. Our major contribution is further generalizing these findings to deep bidirectional architectures, allowing the same pre-trained model to successfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.\n",
