          "Understanding long-form videos (>>15 minutes) poses a major challenge in multimodal intelligence [9, 13, 51, 48]. Compared with short clips, long videos contain complex event structures and require sustained comprehension across thousands of frames, supporting tasks such as video question answering (QA) [23, 26, 2, 51, 48], temporal grounding [10, 18, 54, 34, 57], and dense captioning [65, 18, 14]. These capabilities further underpin real-world applications such as soccer event spotting [25] and long-range film understanding [38]. Recent LMMs [8, 24, 46, 49, 58] exhibit promising short video reasoning, yet most rely on the R1-style paradigm [11]—supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning (RL) [35]. Such pipelines remain largely language-centric, limiting visual reasoning and increasing hallucinations in long-video scenarios [59]. Moreover, their uniform sampling fails to adaptively capture key visual evidence, often missing fine-grained or decisive moments critical for long-video reasoning. This motivates our central question: Can LMMs reliably reason over long videos by performing human-like visual operations to guide their reasoning?",
          "Let us consider the following scenario: a testee is asked to answer the question, “Which foot did the French player use to execute the volley, equalizing the score?” using only the silent video of a football match. Without audio, metadata, or timeline markers, the testee must rely purely on visual inspection. Based on common viewing habits, a human would typically jump through the video in coarse intervals, searching for strong visual indicators of a goal—such as crowd reactions, player celebrations, referee gestures, or scoreboard updates. After locating a likely scoring segment, the testee would rewind slightly and examine the surrounding frames more carefully to pinpoint the exact equalizing moment, and then verify the scoring foot using close-up shots. Notably, when we prompt two state-of-the-art proprietary LMMs (i.e., GPT-5 [42] and Gemini 2.5 Pro [5]) with the same task, the strategies they propose closely mirror this human-intuitive procedure (see Section 7).",
          "As illustrated in Figure 1, the testee, seeking to save time, avoids scanning the entire video frame by frame. Instead, they first perform a coarse global skim and then zoom in on promising segments. When projected to the LMM setting, this global-to-local reasoning strategy enables models with limited context length to process extremely long videos effectively. To implement such a strategy, we design interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought (iMCoTT) that enables LMMs to naturally interleave reasoning with on-demand temporal retrieval via dynamically selecting and re-inspecting interested video segments. Such LMM behaviors stem from their native temporal grounding capabilities, without an auxiliary expert model or external retriever. Our designed iMCoTT enables “looking again” by proposing a more robust time window, examining that snippet, and revising its hypothesis when necessary. Such capability helps reduce hallucinations and reveals more fine-grained details, akin to human self-reflection after realizing that an initially inspected segment was erroneous.",
          "This human-inspired “Thinking with Long Videos” paradigm is naturally suitable for queries that either require aggregating clues across multiple shots or hinge on a brief and evidence-bearing segment within hours-long footage. Yet, the open-source community lacks training and evaluation data with such fine-grained queries: most public datasets emphasize general and high-level questions but rarely train and evaluate reasoning capability under a “Video Segment-In-A-Haystack” setting. We address this grand challenge by constructing VideoSIAH that comprises high-quality QA pairs and tool-augmented reasoning traces. VideoSIAH comprises 247.9K samples for SFT, 1.6K samples for agentic RL, and 15.4K samples for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), respectively. Besides, we curate a dedicated evaluation benchmark, VideoSIAH-Eval, comprising 1,280 QA pairs that have undergone human-in-the-loop validation [3], where each question’s supporting evidence lies within a narrow window relative to the full video duration.",
          "In this paper, we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that elicits LMMs’ ability for “Thinking with Long Videos” via a three-stage training strategy with large-scale and high-quality Tool-augmented data from VideoSIAH. The first stage performs cold-start SFT that empowers the base LMM with three fundamental capabilities: (1) proposing a precise window for relevant event(s), (2) reasoning over densely resampled frames within the window, and (3) self-correcting when the window is suboptimal. The second stage adopts agentic RL for enhancing the model’s generalization over open-ended QA tasks. Unlike existing work that relies on answer-only rewards for video QA and IoU rewards for temporal grounding [8, 49], we design a joint answer-temporal grounding reward function that explicitly encourages exploratory rollouts with improved temporal localization while preserving answer correctness. The third stage leverages agentic RFT where the model is further optimized by utilizing filtered rollout traces distilled from its own RL-trained policy. This stage stabilizes agentic behaviors learned during RL and consolidates fine-grained temporal localization and multi-step reasoning.",
          "The contributions of our work can be summarized in three major aspects. First, we introduce an end-to-end agentic paradigm that natively interleaves multimodal tool-augmented CoT with on-demand clip inspection over hours-long videos, thereby enabling LMMs to perform more effective and reliable long-video reasoning. Second, to facilitate training and evaluation of evidence-sparse long-video reasoning, we construct a scalable data pipeline that produces diverse and high-quality QAs and tool-integrated reasoning traces, and a dedicated benchmark under a video segment-in-a-haystack setting. Third, we conduct comprehensive ablations on data recipes, training strategies, and design choices, together with extensive analysis on training dynamics, establishing a state-of-the-art baseline for “Thinking with Long Videos” with invaluable insights."

          "Long-video reasoning presents a fundamentally different challenge from previous video QA settings: LMMs must locate sparse, fine-grained, and causally decisive moments embedded within hours-long content. However, existing tool-augmented LMMs [39, 59] are mostly trained with coarse-grained and clip-level data. This mismatch leaves modern LMMs lacking the supervision needed to learn how temporal hypotheses are formed, verified, or revised—a critical yet underexplored capability for agentic long-video reasoning. Moreover, most existing video understanding benchmarks [9, 51, 48] only offer multiple-choice QAs, which can be solved without genuine temporal grounding and are vulnerable to dataset leakage or shortcut exploitation. Evidence and discussion can be found in Section 8. To fill this gap, we introduce VideoSIAH, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality data suite that serves collectively as a training dataset capturing the reasoning dynamics required for segment-in-a-haystack question-answering, and a fine-grained evaluation benchmark, VideoSIAH-Eval, with human-in-the-loop validation for long-video open-ended question-answering."

              "As illustrated in Figure 2, VideoSIAH is curated through a semi-automatic, human-in-the-loop pipeline that constructs temporally grounded reasoning traces aligned with human cognitive processes during evidence-sparse long-video reasoning. We begin with automatic scene detection on long videos and merge consecutive segments shorter than 10 seconds to obtain semantically stable units for downstream QA generation. For each segment, Qwen2.5-VL-72B [1] generates detailed descriptions capturing salient objects, spatial relations, and evolving events. These captions serve as the semantic basis for generating temporally grounded QA pairs. Initial QAs are created from the captions, covering temporal events, spatial layouts, motion, object attributes, and scene transitions, ensuring broad coverage at scale.",
              "To ensure quality, we employ two filtering stages: (1) text-based QA filtering, which removes low-quality or ill-posed QAs (e.g., answer leakage) using linguistic heuristics and model agreement; and (2) multimodal QA filtering, where GLM-4.5V [12] verifies answer consistency against the video segment, eliminating hallucinated and visually unsupported claims. Annotator feedback further refines prompting rules for QA generation, filtering, and iMCoTT construction. This prompt-feedback refinement loop boosts reliability without heavy manual annotation, yielding high-fidelity, temporally grounded, and scalable data."

              "As shown in Table 1, VideoSIAH comprises 228,835 SFT samples with normal (non-tool) CoT annotation, 19,161 tool-augmented SFT samples, and 17,020 instances used for RL and RFT. In the SFT split, the non-tool portion is dominated by long-video reasoning data [4], complemented by Video-R1-CoT [8] and a smaller amount of hard image-based CoT supervision. Detailed breakdown can be found in Section 9. The tool-augmented subset combines Gemini 2.5 Flash [5] distilled CoT traces (i.e., iMCoTT) for open-ended QA and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct [1] distilled traces for temporal grounding, providing joint supervision for tool usage and timestamp prediction. For the RL split, we filtered a high-quality subset of QA instances from Section 3.1. For RFT, we further select high-quality RL rollout traces for post-RL refinement, providing dense supervision that enables the policy to go well beyond the SFT-only performance ceiling. Together, these components yield a large-scale and diverse dataset spanning SFT, RL, and RFT, covering high-level reasoning, temporal grounding, and tool-integrated behaviors. For evaluation, we introduce the VideoSIAH-Eval benchmark, which consists of 244 videos and 1,280 carefully filtered QA pairs via human-in-the-loop validation. This benchmark is specifically designed for long-form video reasoning with an average video duration of approximately 1,688 seconds. The duration distribution is concentrated in the 15-30 minute range (71.84%), with the remaining 28.16% of videos being longer than 30 minutes."

              "As shown in Figure 3-(b), our preliminary RL experiments using Qwen2.5-VL-7B [1] as the baseline model reveal that the model fails to improve during RL and ultimately collapses with continued training. This analysis of training dynamics indicates two major deficiencies of the base LMM: (1) the inability to correctly localize the relevant temporal window within long video, and (2) insufficient reasoning capability when integrating tool outputs. We also present a straightforward example in Figure 14 that illustrates the necessity of a cold-start SFT stage. These limitations highlight that the model’s native tool-calling abilities are too weak for direct RL training. Therefore, a cold-start stage is indispensable for establishing a reliable foundation. After applying SFT cold start, the model’s tool-calling activeness improves substantially and continues to increase steadily during RL, supported by results in Table 3."

              "In this stage, we treat the model as a tool-using agent that decides when to inspect the video, how long to crop, and how to integrate the retrieved evidence into its reasoning. We employ GRPO [35] to achieve this objective. In addition, we introduce a three-part reward modeling that jointly optimizes answer accuracy, format compliance, and temporal grounding precision of sampled trajectories, namely, joint answer-temporal grounding reward. Prior work [8, 49] typically targets either answer correctness or time alignment in isolation. We take a further step toward unifying these signals within a single reward function for open-ended long-video QA. This coupling ties answer selection to where the evidence lies in time, improving final-answer correctness and promoting more effective tool use at inference, with more reliable and precise timestamp proposals.",

              "Recent work [40] argues that RFT has become a key ingredient for equipping large language models and their multimodal counterparts with strong reasoning capabilities, since it optimizes sequence-level rewards that directly reflect task success rather than token-level likelihood, and consistently improves performance across diverse modalities and tasks. Motivated by these findings, we further leverage RFT to stabilize model’s agentic behaviors and consolidate multimodal reasoning. Specifically, we select high-quality cases from early RL rollouts that exhibit both accurate temporal localization and coherent reasoning toward the final answer, and incorporate these trajectories back into the supervised fine-tuning curriculum as privileged and self-distilled demonstrations. Empirically (see Section 5.3), we find that learning from these in-distribution high-quality trajectories helps the model internalize robust grounding and tool-calling patterns complementary to large-scale agentic RL, effectively guiding optimization toward policies that better align answer accuracy, temporal grounding, and tool usage."

Results are reported under two frame-sampling regimes: Sparse Frame Sampling (64 uniformly sampled video frames) and Dense Frame Sampling (512 or 768 uniformly sampled frames; the better result among the two is reported).

In the SFT stage, removing the self-curated iMCoTTs (SFT w/o self-curated iMCoTT) leads to consistent performance drop in long-form video understanding. In addition, when self-curated QAs are removed during RL (RL w/o self-curated QAs), model’s performance drops quickly on VideoSIAH-Eval, with lower answer accuracy, weaker temporal localization, and less systematic tool use, which can also be observed in Figure 3-(b).",

As shown in Figure 3-(a), using Recall as the reward function during RL presents a drawback: the policy can enlarge the predicted span to envelop the ground-truth interval, which monotonically raises the Recall-based score while ignoring boundary quality. This plateau in the curve of Recall Accuracy Score further validates our hypothesized reward hacking. Quantitatively, in the reward-choice rows of Table 3, IoU-rewarded training outperforms Recall on the temporal grounding benchmark [10], while Recall is only marginally above the RL w/o Decoupled Reward variant, pointing to IoU’s tighter handling of boundary agreement. Optimizing with IoU provides smooth shaping over overlap and implicitly penalizes span inflation via the union term, yielding better-aligned boundaries and more disciplined tool use.",

As shown in Figure 3-(b), the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline collapses to near-zero tool calls after training in both configurations (w/ and w/o tool reward), indicating that the model does not internalize the tool’s function. After performing cold-start SFT to obtain LongVT-7B-SFT, tool-call frequency rises during training under both configurations and accuracy improves in tandem. Hence, the tool reward is not required for basic competence: once SFT grounds the tool’s semantics, the model learns when to invoke the tool and when to abstain. Moreover, introducing the tool reward brings little benefit. In the later training stage, the configuration without the tool reward even exhibits slightly higher tool-use frequency, indicating that the binary bonus does not encourage usage and may suppress exploration, while accuracy remains essentially unchanged. Given these observations, we discard the tool reward in our final recipe and rely on the standard accuracy, format, and decoupled IoU reward modeling.",
              "SFT builds competence; RL optimizes decisions; RFT stabilizes behaviors. We ablate each training stage individually and in combination, finding that strong performance emerges only with the full three-stage pipeline. As shown in Figure 3-(b), removing SFT leaves the model with poor tool-use ability: it cannot reliably invoke crop_video tool or integrate cropped evidence into its reasoning. Consistently, the RL-only variant achieves the lowest scores on all four benchmarks (Table 3) and exhibits behavioral inconsistencies during training—often following surface instructions and becoming confused by the returned crop rather than using it as supporting evidence.",
              "SFT teaches the intended tool-use paradigm—selecting temporal windows, inspecting their content, and incorporating the resulting evidence into the final answer. However, SFT remains imitation-driven [22]: it fits demonstrated formats, suffers from exposure bias, and fails to generalize under distribution shift. On long-video QA, SFT alone yields only modest gains. We therefore introduce RL with a temporal-grounding reward, optimized via GRPO. RL enables the policy to learn when to inspect, how long to crop, and how to integrate retrieved evidence. This stage pushes performance beyond the supervised ceiling on held-out videos and unseen question templates (Table 3), aligning with prior findings that GRPO improves reasoning and generalization [11].",
              "Finally, RFT distills high-reward trajectories back into the supervised corpus, providing additional performance gains. On VideoSIAH-Eval, it surpasses the RL-only plateau by a substantial margin and yields our best-performing model, while still delivering consistent improvements on other benchmarks. This demonstrates that consolidating successful rollouts is essential for fully realizing the benefits of temporal-grounding feedback."

          "The core philosophy of our proposed interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought (iMCoTT) entails a “global-to-local” thinking pattern: the model first performs a coarse skim to formulate a hypothesis, and subsequently invokes the native crop_video() tool to inspect specific temporal windows for fine-grained verification. While this design was inspired by human intuition, we observe a striking convergence between our approach and the reasoning behaviors emerging in state-of-the-art proprietary LMMs when they are prompted to perform fine-grained analysis.",
          "To validate this alignment, we queried two leading models, Gemini 2.5 Pro [5] and GPT-5 Thinking [42], regarding their optimal strategies for analyzing fine-grained video details. As illustrated in Figure 5(a), Gemini 2.5 Pro explicitly advocates for a two-stage process: a “Step 1: Coarse Scan” to efficiently locate the general event (e.g., searching for scoreboard changes or crowd reactions), followed by a “Step 2: Fine Scan” to isolate the exact moment and verify details (e.g., scrubbing back 30-60 seconds). This directly mirrors the workflow of our proposed LongVT, where the “Coarse Scan” corresponds to our global preview stage, and the “Fine Scan” is functionally identical to our agentic crop_video() tool calling. Similarly, Figure 5(b) demonstrates that the GPT-series model adopts a hierarchical “Coarse→\\rightarrowMedium→\\rightarrowFine” search strategy. These examples confirm that the “Thinking with Long Videos” paradigm we propose in this work is a natural and necessary evolution for reliable long-form video reasoning, given that such human-aligned reasoning capabilities are currently exclusive to top-tier proprietary models."

        "level": 2,
        "paragraphs": [
          "With the rapid advancements of LMMs, model performance on various benchmarks has steadily improved. However, the “black-box” nature of training data raises a critical question: Do these improvements reflect genuine reasoning capability, or are they partly due to the model memorizing the benchmark samples? To investigate this, we conduct a rigorous contamination study on the Qwen-VL series [1, 44] across two probing settings: (1) No Visual, where we feed the text prompt without video frames to test for direct memorization; (2) Rearranged Choices, where we randomize the mapping between option labels and their textual content (e.g., assigning the original answer A to B) for multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to detect label memorization.",
          "Our experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities in existing benchmarks and highlight the necessity of our proposed VideoSIAH-Eval: Observation 1: “No Visual” Performance Indicates Severe Leakage in Existing Benchmarks. As shown in Table 4, both Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL achieve remarkably high scores on VideoMME and VideoMMMU even without seeing any video frames. Notably, for VideoMME, we specifically evaluate without subtitles to ensure there is no textual leakage, yet Qwen2.5-VL still achieves 40.1%, far exceeding random guessing (∼\\sim25%) for such four-option MCQs. Similar patterns of potential data leakage are observed on VideoMMMU. While the ‘No Visual’ scores of 38.3% (Comprehension) and 39.3% (Perception) might appear similar to VideoMME, they are statistically more improbable given the dataset composition. Our statistics reveal that these subsets are overwhelmingly dominated by MCQs with 10 options (e.g., 286 out of 300 for Comprehension and 279 out of 300 for Perception), implying a random guessing baseline of only ∼10​–​16%\\sim 10\\text{--}16\\%. The fact that the model achieves scores significantly above this threshold absent any visual context indicates a high probability of benchmark memorization. In contrast, performance on VideoSIAH-Eval drops significantly in the “No Visual” setting. Specifically, Qwen3-VL collapses to a score of 0.00. Upon manual inspection, we find that without visual grounding, the model generates repetitive code or refusal messages, which is the expected behavior for a clean and non-contaminated benchmark. Observation 2: “Rearranged Choices” Reveals Overfitting to Option Patterns. For MCQ-based benchmarks, we observe distinct performance drops when answer choices are rearranged. For instance, Qwen2.5-VL drops from 64.3 to 56.0 on VideoMME. This indicates that they heavily rely on memorizing specific option mappings (e.g., the answer to this question is usually “A”) rather than understanding the content. Since VideoSIAH-Eval utilizes a fully open-ended QA format, it is inherently immune to this type of option hacking, providing a more robust assessment of the model’s capabilities.",
          "These findings confirm that existing benchmarks are compromised by data contamination (high “No Visual” scores), option bias (sensitive to “Rearranged Choices”). This motivates the introduction of VideoSIAH-Eval, which ensures: (1) Zero leakage as verified by the 0.00 blind score, and (2) Immunity to option bias via open-ended QA format."

Echoing the training dynamics observed in DeepEyes [63], the trajectory of reflection token proportion discloses a distinct three-phase evolution from exploratory correction to efficient tool exploitation: (1) Verbose Self-Correction (Steps 0∼\\sim50): Initially, reflection density remains high. Due to insufficient localization accuracy, the model relies on extensive self-correction and iterative verbal reasoning to compensate for sub-optimal tool usage. (2) Efficiency Optimization (Steps 50∼\\sim80): A significant drop follows as the policy matures. As the model’s intrinsic grounding capability improves, it identifies prolonged reflection to be redundant, autonomously pruning unnecessary linguistic fillers to maximize reward efficiency. (3) Internalized Proficiency (After 80 Steps): The curve stabilizes at a concise baseline, indicating a shift toward selective reasoning—the model invokes explicit reflection only when resolving ambiguity, having internalized the core semantics of tool interaction. Complementing this, the word cloud (right) confirms that the remaining reflection tokens are semantically grounded (e.g., “segment,” “confirm”), serving as functional anchors for temporal reasoning rather than generating generic linguistic fillers."

However, after receiving the resampled video frames, it fails to integrate the returned evidence to answer the specific question (“which video-game device”). Instead of performing the required reasoning, the model becomes confused by the context shift and reverts to generic video captioning, merely restating superficial scene descriptions. This behavior underscores the importance of the SFT cold start in teaching the model the intended semantics of tool usage, enabling it to correctly interpret tool outputs and incorporate them into its reasoning process."

          "While our efficiency analysis in Section 13 confirms that multi-turn tool interactions do not impose significant latency penalties, the memory footprint of such recursive reasoning remains a bottleneck. The single-agent architecture of LongVT is constrained by the inherent context window of the underlying LMM: as the number of interaction turns increases—driven by the need for multiple crop_video calls to inspect ultra-long or infinite video streams—the accumulation of history tokens (including dense visual features returned by tools) can rapidly exhaust the context budget. This accumulation poses a risk of Out-of-Memory errors during training and imposing performance degradation due to truncation.",
          "A promising future direction to resolve this limitation lies in multi-agent collaboration. Inspired by recent advancements in multi-agent reinforcement learning such as MATPO [32], we envision a hierarchical framework where context management is decoupled from reasoning. In this future paradigm, a “Manager Agent” could orchestrate high-level planning and dispatch sub-tasks to specialized “Worker Agents,” each responsible for inspecting distinct temporal segments or executing specific tool calls. By enabling workers to summarize their observations into concise natural language updates for the manager, such a system could theoretically support infinite-horizon reasoning loops without succumbing to context overflow. We leave the exploration of this scalable, divide-and-conquer architecture to future work."

Specifically, LongVT is augmented with interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought (iMCoTT): first performs a global skim over sampled video frames to form a coarse hypothesis about when evidence likely occurs; then invokes a native video tool crop_video(start_time, end_time) to resample finer-grained frames from a short clip via a hypothesized window and reasons again. Our model itself determines whether to directly answer after one turn (T1T_{1}) or continue for multiple turns (up to T5T_{5}) with self-reflection. During reinforcement learning, we jointly optimize answer correctness (Racc\\textbf{R}_{\\text{acc}}), clean formatting (Rformat\\textbf{R}_{\\text{format}}), and precise temporal grounding (Rtime\\textbf{R}_{\\text{time}}).",

    "full_text": "## 1 Introduction\n\nUnderstanding long-form videos (>>15 minutes) poses a major challenge in multimodal intelligence [9, 13, 51, 48]. Compared with short clips, long videos contain complex event structures and require sustained comprehension across thousands of frames, supporting tasks such as video question answering (QA) [23, 26, 2, 51, 48], temporal grounding [10, 18, 54, 34, 57], and dense captioning [65, 18, 14]. These capabilities further underpin real-world applications such as soccer event spotting [25] and long-range film understanding [38]. Recent LMMs [8, 24, 46, 49, 58] exhibit promising short video reasoning, yet most rely on the R1-style paradigm [11]—supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning (RL) [35]. Such pipelines remain largely language-centric, limiting visual reasoning and increasing hallucinations in long-video scenarios [59]. Moreover, their uniform sampling fails to adaptively capture key visual evidence, often missing fine-grained or decisive moments critical for long-video reasoning. This motivates our central question: Can LMMs reliably reason over long videos by performing human-like visual operations to guide their reasoning?\n\nLet us consider the following scenario: a testee is asked to answer the question, “Which foot did the French player use to execute the volley, equalizing the score?” using only the silent video of a football match. Without audio, metadata, or timeline markers, the testee must rely purely on visual inspection. Based on common viewing habits, a human would typically jump through the video in coarse intervals, searching for strong visual indicators of a goal—such as crowd reactions, player celebrations, referee gestures, or scoreboard updates. After locating a likely scoring segment, the testee would rewind slightly and examine the surrounding frames more carefully to pinpoint the exact equalizing moment, and then verify the scoring foot using close-up shots. Notably, when we prompt two state-of-the-art proprietary LMMs (i.e., GPT-5 [42] and Gemini 2.5 Pro [5]) with the same task, the strategies they propose closely mirror this human-intuitive procedure (see Section 7).\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the testee, seeking to save time, avoids scanning the entire video frame by frame. Instead, they first perform a coarse global skim and then zoom in on promising segments. When projected to the LMM setting, this global-to-local reasoning strategy enables models with limited context length to process extremely long videos effectively. To implement such a strategy, we design interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought (iMCoTT) that enables LMMs to naturally interleave reasoning with on-demand temporal retrieval via dynamically selecting and re-inspecting interested video segments. Such LMM behaviors stem from their native temporal grounding capabilities, without an auxiliary expert model or external retriever. Our designed iMCoTT enables “looking again” by proposing a more robust time window, examining that snippet, and revising its hypothesis when necessary. Such capability helps reduce hallucinations and reveals more fine-grained details, akin to human self-reflection after realizing that an initially inspected segment was erroneous.\n\nThis human-inspired “Thinking with Long Videos” paradigm is naturally suitable for queries that either require aggregating clues across multiple shots or hinge on a brief and evidence-bearing segment within hours-long footage. Yet, the open-source community lacks training and evaluation data with such fine-grained queries: most public datasets emphasize general and high-level questions but rarely train and evaluate reasoning capability under a “Video Segment-In-A-Haystack” setting. We address this grand challenge by constructing VideoSIAH that comprises high-quality QA pairs and tool-augmented reasoning traces. VideoSIAH comprises 247.9K samples for SFT, 1.6K samples for agentic RL, and 15.4K samples for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), respectively. Besides, we curate a dedicated evaluation benchmark, VideoSIAH-Eval, comprising 1,280 QA pairs that have undergone human-in-the-loop validation [3], where each question’s supporting evidence lies within a narrow window relative to the full video duration.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that elicits LMMs’ ability for “Thinking with Long Videos” via a three-stage training strategy with large-scale and high-quality Tool-augmented data from VideoSIAH. The first stage performs cold-start SFT that empowers the base LMM with three fundamental capabilities: (1) proposing a precise window for relevant event(s), (2) reasoning over densely resampled frames within the window, and (3) self-correcting when the window is suboptimal. The second stage adopts agentic RL for enhancing the model’s generalization over open-ended QA tasks. Unlike existing work that relies on answer-only rewards for video QA and IoU rewards for temporal grounding [8, 49], we design a joint answer-temporal grounding reward function that explicitly encourages exploratory rollouts with improved temporal localization while preserving answer correctness. The third stage leverages agentic RFT where the model is further optimized by utilizing filtered rollout traces distilled from its own RL-trained policy. This stage stabilizes agentic behaviors learned during RL and consolidates fine-grained temporal localization and multi-step reasoning.\n\nThe contributions of our work can be summarized in three major aspects. First, we introduce an end-to-end agentic paradigm that natively interleaves multimodal tool-augmented CoT with on-demand clip inspection over hours-long videos, thereby enabling LMMs to perform more effective and reliable long-video reasoning. Second, to facilitate training and evaluation of evidence-sparse long-video reasoning, we construct a scalable data pipeline that produces diverse and high-quality QAs and tool-integrated reasoning traces, and a dedicated benchmark under a video segment-in-a-haystack setting. Third, we conduct comprehensive ablations on data recipes, training strategies, and design choices, together with extensive analysis on training dynamics, establishing a state-of-the-art baseline for “Thinking with Long Videos” with invaluable insights.\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\n## 3 VideoSIAH: A Fine-Grained Data Suite for Evidence-Sparse Long-Video Reasoning\n\nLong-video reasoning presents a fundamentally different challenge from previous video QA settings: LMMs must locate sparse, fine-grained, and causally decisive moments embedded within hours-long content. However, existing tool-augmented LMMs [39, 59] are mostly trained with coarse-grained and clip-level data. This mismatch leaves modern LMMs lacking the supervision needed to learn how temporal hypotheses are formed, verified, or revised—a critical yet underexplored capability for agentic long-video reasoning. Moreover, most existing video understanding benchmarks [9, 51, 48] only offer multiple-choice QAs, which can be solved without genuine temporal grounding and are vulnerable to dataset leakage or shortcut exploitation. Evidence and discussion can be found in Section 8. To fill this gap, we introduce VideoSIAH, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality data suite that serves collectively as a training dataset capturing the reasoning dynamics required for segment-in-a-haystack question-answering, and a fine-grained evaluation benchmark, VideoSIAH-Eval, with human-in-the-loop validation for long-video open-ended question-answering.\n\n### 3.1 Data Pipeline\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, VideoSIAH is curated through a semi-automatic, human-in-the-loop pipeline that constructs temporally grounded reasoning traces aligned with human cognitive processes during evidence-sparse long-video reasoning. We begin with automatic scene detection on long videos and merge consecutive segments shorter than 10 seconds to obtain semantically stable units for downstream QA generation. For each segment, Qwen2.5-VL-72B [1] generates detailed descriptions capturing salient objects, spatial relations, and evolving events. These captions serve as the semantic basis for generating temporally grounded QA pairs. Initial QAs are created from the captions, covering temporal events, spatial layouts, motion, object attributes, and scene transitions, ensuring broad coverage at scale.\n\nTo ensure quality, we employ two filtering stages: (1) text-based QA filtering, which removes low-quality or ill-posed QAs (e.g., answer leakage) using linguistic heuristics and model agreement; and (2) multimodal QA filtering, where GLM-4.5V [12] verifies answer consistency against the video segment, eliminating hallucinated and visually unsupported claims. Annotator feedback further refines prompting rules for QA generation, filtering, and iMCoTT construction. This prompt-feedback refinement loop boosts reliability without heavy manual annotation, yielding high-fidelity, temporally grounded, and scalable data.\n\n### 3.2 Dataset Curation\n\n### 3.3 Dataset Statistics\n\nAs shown in Table 1, VideoSIAH comprises 228,835 SFT samples with normal (non-tool) CoT annotation, 19,161 tool-augmented SFT samples, and 17,020 instances used for RL and RFT. In the SFT split, the non-tool portion is dominated by long-video reasoning data [4], complemented by Video-R1-CoT [8] and a smaller amount of hard image-based CoT supervision. Detailed breakdown can be found in Section 9. The tool-augmented subset combines Gemini 2.5 Flash [5] distilled CoT traces (i.e., iMCoTT) for open-ended QA and Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct [1] distilled traces for temporal grounding, providing joint supervision for tool usage and timestamp prediction. For the RL split, we filtered a high-quality subset of QA instances from Section 3.1. For RFT, we further select high-quality RL rollout traces for post-RL refinement, providing dense supervision that enables the policy to go well beyond the SFT-only performance ceiling. Together, these components yield a large-scale and diverse dataset spanning SFT, RL, and RFT, covering high-level reasoning, temporal grounding, and tool-integrated behaviors. For evaluation, we introduce the VideoSIAH-Eval benchmark, which consists of 244 videos and 1,280 carefully filtered QA pairs via human-in-the-loop validation. This benchmark is specifically designed for long-form video reasoning with an average video duration of approximately 1,688 seconds. The duration distribution is concentrated in the 15-30 minute range (71.84%), with the remaining 28.16% of videos being longer than 30 minutes.\n\n## 4 Training Strategy\n\nTo make full use of the VideoSIAH and elicit robust “Thinking with Long Videos” behaviors, LongVT adopts a three-stage training pipeline: (1) cold-start supervised fine-tuning, which teaches the base model to propose temporal windows, invoke video tools, and compose multimodal evidence; (2) agentic reinforcement learning, which optimizes a joint answer–temporal-grounding reward to refine tool-using rollouts; and (3) agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, which distills high-quality RL trajectories back into supervised data to stabilize these behaviors and consolidate long-horizon reasoning.\n\n### 4.1 Cold-Start Supervised Fine-Tuning\n\nAs shown in Figure 3-(b), our preliminary RL experiments using Qwen2.5-VL-7B [1] as the baseline model reveal that the model fails to improve during RL and ultimately collapses with continued training. This analysis of training dynamics indicates two major deficiencies of the base LMM: (1) the inability to correctly localize the relevant temporal window within long video, and (2) insufficient reasoning capability when integrating tool outputs. We also present a straightforward example in Figure 14 that illustrates the necessity of a cold-start SFT stage. These limitations highlight that the model’s native tool-calling abilities are too weak for direct RL training. Therefore, a cold-start stage is indispensable for establishing a reliable foundation. After applying SFT cold start, the model’s tool-calling activeness improves substantially and continues to increase steadily during RL, supported by results in Table 3.\n\n### 4.2 Agentic Reinforcement Learning\n\nIn this stage, we treat the model as a tool-using agent that decides when to inspect the video, how long to crop, and how to integrate the retrieved evidence into its reasoning. We employ GRPO [35] to achieve this objective. In addition, we introduce a three-part reward modeling that jointly optimizes answer accuracy, format compliance, and temporal grounding precision of sampled trajectories, namely, joint answer-temporal grounding reward. Prior work [8, 49] typically targets either answer correctness or time alignment in isolation. We take a further step toward unifying these signals within a single reward function for open-ended long-video QA. This coupling ties answer selection to where the evidence lies in time, improving final-answer correctness and promoting more effective tool use at inference, with more reliable and precise timestamp proposals.\n\nAnswer Accuracy. Let KK be the number of sampled rollouts in a group. For the kk-th rollout (k∈{1,…,K}k\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}), let a^(k)\\hat{a}^{(k)} denote its generated answer and let a⋆a^{\\star} denote the ground-truth answer. We employ LLM-as-a-Judge [55] to obtain a categorical verdict\n\nwhere F = fully consistent (semantically equivalent to a⋆a^{\\star}), P = partially consistent (contains some correct information but is incomplete or imprecise), and I = inconsistent (incorrect or contradictory).\n\nThe accuracy reward is then defined as the normalized score\n\nFormat Compliance. Let y(k)y^{(k)} denote the full textual output of the kk-th rollout and let 𝒮\\mathcal{S} be the required output schema. Define\n\nTemporal Overlap. Following previous temporal grounding work [8, 24], we use standard temporal IoU as the reward function for temporal localization. For a prediction [ts,te][t_{s},t_{e}] and ground truth [ts′,te′][t^{\\prime}_{s},t^{\\prime}_{e}],\n\nHence Rtime(k)=1\\textbf{R}_{\\text{time}}^{(k)}=1 only when the predicted span matches the ground-truth interval exactly, and Rtime(k)=0\\textbf{R}_{\\text{time}}^{(k)}=0 when there is no temporal overlap. This simple form proved sufficient to drive grounded cropping and tighter timestamp proposals during tool use.\n\nOverall Reward.\n\n### 4.3 Agentic Reinforcement Fine-tuning\n\nRecent work [40] argues that RFT has become a key ingredient for equipping large language models and their multimodal counterparts with strong reasoning capabilities, since it optimizes sequence-level rewards that directly reflect task success rather than token-level likelihood, and consistently improves performance across diverse modalities and tasks. Motivated by these findings, we further leverage RFT to stabilize model’s agentic behaviors and consolidate multimodal reasoning. Specifically, we select high-quality cases from early RL rollouts that exhibit both accurate temporal localization and coherent reasoning toward the final answer, and incorporate these trajectories back into the supervised fine-tuning curriculum as privileged and self-distilled demonstrations. Empirically (see Section 5.3), we find that learning from these in-distribution high-quality trajectories helps the model internalize robust grounding and tool-calling patterns complementary to large-scale agentic RL, effectively guiding optimization toward policies that better align answer accuracy, temporal grounding, and tool usage.\n\n### 4.4 Overall Framework\n\nAs visualized in Figure 4, LongVT operates in an iterative “hypothesis-verification” cycle. This behavioral capability is incentivized via cold-start SFT, enabling the model to skim global frames and proactively invoke the crop_video tool to resample fine-grained evidence. In cases where the initial retrieval (e.g., at T1T_{1}) proves insufficient, the model leverages learned self-correction to re-invoke the tool (e.g., at T2T_{2}) with refined parameters. Crucially, this entire decision-making trajectory is consolidated via agentic RL, which optimizes the policy against the joint answer-temporal grounding reward (Racc+Rformat+Rtime\\textbf{R}_{\\text{acc}}+\\textbf{R}_{\\text{format}}+\\textbf{R}_{\\text{time}}), enhancing the model’s generalization ability to further align with human-like verification strategies.\n\n## 5 Experiments\n\n### 5.1 Experimental Setup\n\nWe utilize Qwen2.5-VL-7B [1] as the baseline model in all experiments. We report the performance of three LongVT variants based on their training stages against Qwen2.5-VL-7B and other open-source video-centric LMMs including Video-R1-7B [8], VideoRFT-7B [46], and Video-Thinker-7B [47] plus proprietary LMMs such as GPT-4o [16] and Gemini 1.5 Pro [41]. Note that we do not include direct comparisons to the concurrent tool-augmented video-centric LMM [59], since its model checkpoints are not publicly available, which hinders fair and reproducible experiments. We evaluate all models on four long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks, namely VideoMME [9], VideoMMMU [13], LVBench [48], and our self-curated VideoSIAH-Eval, leveraging a unified evaluation framework [60] for fair comparison. Results are reported under two frame-sampling regimes: Sparse Frame Sampling (64 uniformly sampled video frames) and Dense Frame Sampling (512 or 768 uniformly sampled frames; the better result among the two is reported). Reasoning Prompt indicates whether a standard reasoning-style prompt (✓) or a direct question-answering prompt (✗) is applied; Tool Calling denotes whether native tool calling is enabled (✓) or disabled (✗) in the prompt. More implementation details can be found in Section 12.\n\n### 5.2 Main Results\n\nAs shown in Table 2, our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art among open-source video-centric LMMs under both sparse and dense frame sampling settings. When evaluating at 64 frames, LongVT-7B-RL slightly surpasses the best existing open-source baseline. Under dense frame sampling, both LongVT-7B-RL and LongVT-7B-RFT yield more dominant performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin. On the challenging VideoSIAH-Eval, which involves open-ended QAs that require the retrieval of fine-grained evidence from hours-long videos, LongVT-7B-RFT reaches 42.0, outperforming the second-best model by 6 points. This confirms that LongVT achieves stronger long-video reasoning and exhibits an emergent ability to invoke native tools for temporal localization. Notably, the gap between open-source and proprietary LMMs has narrowed substantially: LongVT’s best-performing checkpoint lies within roughly four points of GPT-4o on average, marking a significant step forward in long-video reasoning capability among open-source LMMs.\n\n### 5.3 Ablation Studies\n\nFine-grained reasoning data matters. As shown in Table 3, our self-curated training data plays a crucial role in shaping the model’s reasoning behavior when dealing with long-form videos. In the SFT stage, removing the self-curated iMCoTTs (SFT w/o self-curated iMCoTT) leads to consistent performance drop in long-form video understanding. In addition, when self-curated QAs are removed during RL (RL w/o self-curated QAs), model’s performance drops quickly on VideoSIAH-Eval, with lower answer accuracy, weaker temporal localization, and less systematic tool use, which can also be observed in Figure 3-(b).\n\nRecall encourages coverage; IoU demands precision. As shown in Figure 3-(a), using Recall as the reward function during RL presents a drawback: the policy can enlarge the predicted span to envelop the ground-truth interval, which monotonically raises the Recall-based score while ignoring boundary quality. This plateau in the curve of Recall Accuracy Score further validates our hypothesized reward hacking. Quantitatively, in the reward-choice rows of Table 3, IoU-rewarded training outperforms Recall on the temporal grounding benchmark [10], while Recall is only marginally above the RL w/o Decoupled Reward variant, pointing to IoU’s tighter handling of boundary agreement. Optimizing with IoU provides smooth shaping over overlap and implicitly penalizes span inflation via the union term, yielding better-aligned boundaries and more disciplined tool use.\n\nIs tool reward really necessary? As shown in Figure 3-(b), the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline collapses to near-zero tool calls after training in both configurations (w/ and w/o tool reward), indicating that the model does not internalize the tool’s function. After performing cold-start SFT to obtain LongVT-7B-SFT, tool-call frequency rises during training under both configurations and accuracy improves in tandem. Hence, the tool reward is not required for basic competence: once SFT grounds the tool’s semantics, the model learns when to invoke the tool and when to abstain. Moreover, introducing the tool reward brings little benefit. In the later training stage, the configuration without the tool reward even exhibits slightly higher tool-use frequency, indicating that the binary bonus does not encourage usage and may suppress exploration, while accuracy remains essentially unchanged. Given these observations, we discard the tool reward in our final recipe and rely on the standard accuracy, format, and decoupled IoU reward modeling.\n\nSFT builds competence; RL optimizes decisions; RFT stabilizes behaviors. We ablate each training stage individually and in combination, finding that strong performance emerges only with the full three-stage pipeline. As shown in Figure 3-(b), removing SFT leaves the model with poor tool-use ability: it cannot reliably invoke crop_video tool or integrate cropped evidence into its reasoning. Consistently, the RL-only variant achieves the lowest scores on all four benchmarks (Table 3) and exhibits behavioral inconsistencies during training—often following surface instructions and becoming confused by the returned crop rather than using it as supporting evidence.\n\nSFT teaches the intended tool-use paradigm—selecting temporal windows, inspecting their content, and incorporating the resulting evidence into the final answer. However, SFT remains imitation-driven [22]: it fits demonstrated formats, suffers from exposure bias, and fails to generalize under distribution shift. On long-video QA, SFT alone yields only modest gains. We therefore introduce RL with a temporal-grounding reward, optimized via GRPO. RL enables the policy to learn when to inspect, how long to crop, and how to integrate retrieved evidence. This stage pushes performance beyond the supervised ceiling on held-out videos and unseen question templates (Table 3), aligning with prior findings that GRPO improves reasoning and generalization [11].\n\nFinally, RFT distills high-reward trajectories back into the supervised corpus, providing additional performance gains. On VideoSIAH-Eval, it surpasses the RL-only plateau by a substantial margin and yields our best-performing model, while still delivering consistent improvements on other benchmarks. This demonstrates that consolidating successful rollouts is essential for fully realizing the benefits of temporal-grounding feedback.\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we present LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables LMMs to reliably reason over long videos. By interleaving multimodal tool-augmented CoT with on-demand temporal inspection, LongVT transforms long-video understanding from passive frame consumption into active, evidence-seeking reasoning. Supported by self-curated VideoSIAH, a large-scale, fine-grained data suite built specifically for evidence-sparse long-video reasoning tasks, our proposed three-stage training pipeline yields substantial and consistent improvements compared to existing strong baselines.\n\n## 7 LongVT Performs Human-Aligned Thinking like Leading Proprietary LMMs\n\nThe core philosophy of our proposed interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought (iMCoTT) entails a “global-to-local” thinking pattern: the model first performs a coarse skim to formulate a hypothesis, and subsequently invokes the native crop_video() tool to inspect specific temporal windows for fine-grained verification. While this design was inspired by human intuition, we observe a striking convergence between our approach and the reasoning behaviors emerging in state-of-the-art proprietary LMMs when they are prompted to perform fine-grained analysis.\n\nTo validate this alignment, we queried two leading models, Gemini 2.5 Pro [5] and GPT-5 Thinking [42], regarding their optimal strategies for analyzing fine-grained video details. As illustrated in Figure 5(a), Gemini 2.5 Pro explicitly advocates for a two-stage process: a “Step 1: Coarse Scan” to efficiently locate the general event (e.g., searching for scoreboard changes or crowd reactions), followed by a “Step 2: Fine Scan” to isolate the exact moment and verify details (e.g., scrubbing back 30-60 seconds). This directly mirrors the workflow of our proposed LongVT, where the “Coarse Scan” corresponds to our global preview stage, and the “Fine Scan” is functionally identical to our agentic crop_video() tool calling. Similarly, Figure 5(b) demonstrates that the GPT-series model adopts a hierarchical “Coarse→\\rightarrowMedium→\\rightarrowFine” search strategy. These examples confirm that the “Thinking with Long Videos” paradigm we propose in this work is a natural and necessary evolution for reliable long-form video reasoning, given that such human-aligned reasoning capabilities are currently exclusive to top-tier proprietary models.\n\n## 8 What Motivates VideoSIAH? Unveiling the Data Contamination in Qwen-VL Series\n\nWith the rapid advancements of LMMs, model performance on various benchmarks has steadily improved. However, the “black-box” nature of training data raises a critical question: Do these improvements reflect genuine reasoning capability, or are they partly due to the model memorizing the benchmark samples? To investigate this, we conduct a rigorous contamination study on the Qwen-VL series [1, 44] across two probing settings: (1) No Visual, where we feed the text prompt without video frames to test for direct memorization; (2) Rearranged Choices, where we randomize the mapping between option labels and their textual content (e.g., assigning the original answer A to B) for multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to detect label memorization.\n\nOur experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities in existing benchmarks and highlight the necessity of our proposed VideoSIAH-Eval: Observation 1: “No Visual” Performance Indicates Severe Leakage in Existing Benchmarks. As shown in Table 4, both Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL achieve remarkably high scores on VideoMME and VideoMMMU even without seeing any video frames. Notably, for VideoMME, we specifically evaluate without subtitles to ensure there is no textual leakage, yet Qwen2.5-VL still achieves 40.1%, far exceeding random guessing (∼\\sim25%) for such four-option MCQs. Similar patterns of potential data leakage are observed on VideoMMMU. While the ‘No Visual’ scores of 38.3% (Comprehension) and 39.3% (Perception) might appear similar to VideoMME, they are statistically more improbable given the dataset composition. Our statistics reveal that these subsets are overwhelmingly dominated by MCQs with 10 options (e.g., 286 out of 300 for Comprehension and 279 out of 300 for Perception), implying a random guessing baseline of only ∼10​–​16%\\sim 10\\text{--}16\\%. The fact that the model achieves scores significantly above this threshold absent any visual context indicates a high probability of benchmark memorization. In contrast, performance on VideoSIAH-Eval drops significantly in the “No Visual” setting. Specifically, Qwen3-VL collapses to a score of 0.00. Upon manual inspection, we find that without visual grounding, the model generates repetitive code or refusal messages, which is the expected behavior for a clean and non-contaminated benchmark. Observation 2: “Rearranged Choices” Reveals Overfitting to Option Patterns. For MCQ-based benchmarks, we observe distinct performance drops when answer choices are rearranged. For instance, Qwen2.5-VL drops from 64.3 to 56.0 on VideoMME. This indicates that they heavily rely on memorizing specific option mappings (e.g., the answer to this question is usually “A”) rather than understanding the content. Since VideoSIAH-Eval utilizes a fully open-ended QA format, it is inherently immune to this type of option hacking, providing a more robust assessment of the model’s capabilities.\n\nThese findings confirm that existing benchmarks are compromised by data contamination (high “No Visual” scores), option bias (sensitive to “Rearranged Choices”). This motivates the introduction of VideoSIAH-Eval, which ensures: (1) Zero leakage as verified by the 0.00 blind score, and (2) Immunity to option bias via open-ended QA format.\n\n## 9 Additional VideoSIAH Details\n\n## 10 Additional Methodological Details\n\n## 11 Reflection Trajectory: From Verbose Self-Correction to Internalized Tool Usage\n\nWe visualize the evolution of the model’s internal thought process in Figure 7 (left). Echoing the training dynamics observed in DeepEyes [63], the trajectory of reflection token proportion discloses a distinct three-phase evolution from exploratory correction to efficient tool exploitation: (1) Verbose Self-Correction (Steps 0∼\\sim50): Initially, reflection density remains high. Due to insufficient localization accuracy, the model relies on extensive self-correction and iterative verbal reasoning to compensate for sub-optimal tool usage. (2) Efficiency Optimization (Steps 50∼\\sim80): A significant drop follows as the policy matures. As the model’s intrinsic grounding capability improves, it identifies prolonged reflection to be redundant, autonomously pruning unnecessary linguistic fillers to maximize reward efficiency. (3) Internalized Proficiency (After 80 Steps): The curve stabilizes at a concise baseline, indicating a shift toward selective reasoning—the model invokes explicit reflection only when resolving ambiguity, having internalized the core semantics of tool interaction. Complementing this, the word cloud (right) confirms that the remaining reflection tokens are semantically grounded (e.g., “segment,” “confirm”), serving as functional anchors for temporal reasoning rather than generating generic linguistic fillers.\n\n## 12 Additional Implementation Details\n\nThe full set of experimental hyperparameters is detailed in Table 6.\n\n## 13 Inference Efficiency Analysis\n\n## 14 Examples\n\n## 15 Failure Case Analysis\n\nTo further illustrate the instability of the RL-only variant discussed in Section 5.3 of the main paper, we present a representative failure case. As shown in Figure 14, the model correctly recognizes the need to invoke a tool to inspect the glass coffee table. However, after receiving the resampled video frames, it fails to integrate the returned evidence to answer the specific question (“which video-game device”). Instead of performing the required reasoning, the model becomes confused by the context shift and reverts to generic video captioning, merely restating superficial scene descriptions. This behavior underscores the importance of the SFT cold start in teaching the model the intended semantics of tool usage, enabling it to correctly interpret tool outputs and incorporate them into its reasoning process.\n\n## 16 Limitation and Future Direction\n\nWhile our efficiency analysis in Section 13 confirms that multi-turn tool interactions do not impose significant latency penalties, the memory footprint of such recursive reasoning remains a bottleneck. The single-agent architecture of LongVT is constrained by the inherent context window of the underlying LMM: as the number of interaction turns increases—driven by the need for multiple crop_video calls to inspect ultra-long or infinite video streams—the accumulation of history tokens (including dense visual features returned by tools) can rapidly exhaust the context budget. This accumulation poses a risk of Out-of-Memory errors during training and imposing performance degradation due to truncation.\n\nA promising future direction to resolve this limitation lies in multi-agent collaboration. Inspired by recent advancements in multi-agent reinforcement learning such as MATPO [32], we envision a hierarchical framework where context management is decoupled from reasoning. In this future paradigm, a “Manager Agent” could orchestrate high-level planning and dispatch sub-tasks to specialized “Worker Agents,” each responsible for inspecting distinct temporal segments or executing specific tool calls. By enabling workers to summarize their observations into concise natural language updates for the manager, such a system could theoretically support infinite-horizon reasoning loops without succumbing to context overflow. We leave the exploration of this scalable, divide-and-conquer architecture to future work.\n\n## 17 Broader Impact\n\nLongVT advances the field of long-video understanding by introducing an agentic framework capable of proactive evidence seeking and self-correction. By enabling LMMs to dynamically inspect and re-examine video segments, this work addresses critical reliability issues—such as hallucinations and temporal misalignment that hinder the deployment of AI in high-stakes domains. As video-based AI systems become integral to applications ranging from automated surveillance and content moderation to educational analytics and assistive technologies for the visually impaired, the improved factual grounding and transparency offered by LongVT support safer and more trustworthy interactions.\n\n## 18 Ethical Considerations\n",
